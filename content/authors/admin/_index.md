Caleb Lareau is currently a Stanford Science Fellow and Parker Scholar at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He completed his PhD in 2020 at Harvard Medical School focusing on the development of new single-cell genomics technologies, including methods of clonal lineage tracing in humans. Caleb's research at Stanford is supervised by Ansuman Satpathy and Anshul Kundaje in the Departments of Pathology and Genetics. His current work focuses on the application of single-cell technologies to understand dynamics of immune cells in human health and in diseases such as cancer.
